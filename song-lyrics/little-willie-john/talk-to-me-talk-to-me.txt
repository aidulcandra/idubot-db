Talk To Me
Sunny and the Sunglows
Talk to me
Talk to me

Ooo I love the things you say
Talk to me
Talk to me
In your own

Sweet gentle way
Let me hear
Tell me dear
Tell me oooo

You love me so
Talk to me
Talk to me
Tell me what

I want to know
The many ways
You speak of love
I've heard before

But it sounds so good
Everytime
Please say the one part
I love once more

Talk to me
Talk to me
Hold me close
Whisper low

Talk to me
Baby can't you see
Oh darlin I
I love you so
