Sans, Sans, wake up
What is it, dude?
A human has fallen from the surface world
Really? And you got a bone to pick wit' 'em?
No time for puns
Come on, that was a real rib tickler, ayy
Ugh, enough
Alright, here we go again

Welcome to the underground
How was the fall?
If you wanna look around
Give us a call
We don't see humans often
We're happy you just dropped in
I'll be so popular
When I show all the monsters what I just brought in
Hey Papyrus, mind your manners
Can it, Sans, no time for banter
Excuse my brother, he's a bit eccentric
You're just lazy and apathetic
Call me what you want, I got thick skin
Another bad joke and I'm finished with him
We are monsters, the awfullest kind
To mess with us takes a lot of spine

We can relate to your determination
Because we monsters have our motivations
Humans betrayed us and left us burnin'
One day we'll make our way back to the surface
Through all your travels, your sins will follow
Your consequences aren't easy to swallow
Who's the real monster, now you should know
You've cut this story down to the bone

Really, Sans?
What?
The last line of the chorus is a pun?
Yup
You imbecile
That was very clever
Heh, thanks, buddy

You're stuck in the underground
Thanks to the fall
Good luck ever getting out
Prepare to brawl
You could show mercy to us
Or turn all of us to dust
Is your heart full of evil
Or full of love?
I, the great Papyrus
Challenge you to try getting by us
Test the human with one of your puzzles
Brilliant, Sans, that'll leave him befuddled
I dare you to try a bite of spaghetti
Smells like the creepy pasta is ready
Stop it Sans, I'm done with the jokin'
Sounds like someone's funny bone's broken

We can relate to your determination
Because we monsters have our motivations
I am the mastermind, he's my accomplice
You're only still alive because I made a promise
You'll lose your mind when you wander for hours
You might even decide to start talkin' to flowers
Who's the real monster, now you should know
You've cut this story down to the bone

Someday I'll join the royal guard
When I catch this child, can it be that hard
Look, if I'm being honest
My brother ain't nothin' but harmless
I know you and all that you want
You'll get a lot more from Sans than a font
The deeper you go, the messier it gets
If I had it my way, you'd already be dead
Kidding, if you couldn't tell
I get so bored, I amuse myself
Down here in the underground
You're all alone
We wanted to tell you now
You're kinda boned
If you survive this prison
You will know nihilism
Don't mess around with monsters
They're scared of tiny children
You've come far, but soon you'll stumble
When I stump you with some junior jumble
Not so sure you'll get him with that
Alas, I'll hit him with my special attack
Leave me alone
You know I've got a knack for the trombone
One more pun, and I'll be done
But ain't two skulls better than one

We can relate to your determination
Because we monsters have our motivations
You know your story's already been told
We can play again if you sell your soul
I've got my eye on you so you just watch it
I'll find any skeletons inside your closet
Who's the real monster now you should know
You've cut this story down to the bone
