You speak to me
And in your words I hear a melody
But in the twilight it's so hard to see
What's wrong for me

I can't resist
Until you give the truth a little twist
As if you're gonna get away with this
You're not sorry

I can't believe I fell for this

I fell through the hole
Down at the bottom of your soul
Didn't think you could go
So low
Look at what you've done
You're losing me
Here's what you've won
Got me planning to go
Solo
Solo

You sing to me
Too bad you couldn't even stay on key
If your life is such a mystery
Why don't you just stick to acting?

Oh, here you go again (Go again)
You couldn't find my number until when (Until when)
You thought that you could get to my best friend
Without a script your game is lacking

I can't believe I fell for this

I fell through the hole
Down at the bottom of your soul
Didn't think you could go
So low
Look at what you've done
You're losing me
Here's what you've won
Got me planning to go
Solo
Solo

I'd rather go out to a party alone
Than have to walk around with you on my arm
Now that I'm proud to admit that we're done
Good luck trying to find me, oh

'Cause I didn't think you could go
So low
Look at what you've done
You're losing me
Here's what you've won
Got me planning to go
Solo

Now we're done
'Cause you got me planning to go
Solo
Solo
Solo
Solo
