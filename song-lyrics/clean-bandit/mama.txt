Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, I do, I do now

I see my body in a different light
I, I, I
As if I woke up in a different life
I, I, I
Feels like I'm walking with my heart on fire
Somebody pass me the water
'Cause I'm burning

'Cause a little bit turning into a lot
There's no way I'd be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought I was not
Tell me, tell me
I, I, I

Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now?
Do with all of this
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, I do, I do now

I've never felt so good, I feel so soft
Na-na-na
And now I know myself, I know my spots
Na-na-na
I didn't know that I could have these thoughts, yeah, yeah
Somebody pass me the water
'Cause I'm burning
¡Qué calor!

'Cause a little bit turning into a lot
There's no way I'd be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought I was not
Tell me, tell me
I, I, I

Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now?
Do with all of this
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, I do, I do now

Everything I thought I knew about me's upside down
Everything is changing but I think I love it now
I, I, I

Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now?
Do with all of this
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, I do, I do now

All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, I do, I do now
