not feeling well today
scared to do mistakes
nobody seems to understand
they're all just the same


what am i supposed to do
have to be nice
while i'm broken inside
things in my head messin' it through


i overthink a lot
in so many things about
it hurt so bad i can't help it
i cried out every night
my pillow hold me tight
all the pain keeps reaching me inside
can't run, it keeps pullin' me down


how?
how?

running alone feels like there's no way home
keepin' my distance to all of the people i know
just wanna know how
