Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down

I'm the one for a "good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love

One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier

From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist

Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night

Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier

From the chandelier

But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight

Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame (ah)

One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier

From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist

Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night

Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier

From the chandelier

But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight

'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
