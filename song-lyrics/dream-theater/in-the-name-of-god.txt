How can this be?
Why is he the chosen one?
Saint gone astray
With a scepter and a gun

Learn to believe
In the mighty and the strong
Come bleed the beast
Follow me it won't be long

Listen
When the prophet speaks to you
Killing
In the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into
Violence
In the name of God

Straight is the path leading to your salvation
Slaying the weak, ethnic elimination
Any day we'll all be swept away
You'll be saved as long as you obey

Lies
Tools of the devil inside
Written in Holy disguise
Meant to deceive and divide us all

Listen
When the prophet speaks to you
Killing
In the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into
Violence
In the name of God

Blurring the lines
Between virtue and sin
They can't tell
Where God ends and mankind begins

They know no other life but this
From the cradle they are claimed

Listen
When the prophet speaks to you
Killing
In the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into
Violence
In the name of God

Hundreds of believers
Lured into a doomsday cult
All would perish in the name of God

Self-proclaimed messiah
Led his servants to their death
Eighty murdered in the name of God

Forty sons and daughters
Un-consenting plural wives
Perversions in the name of God

Underground religion
Turning toward the mainstream light
Blind devotion in the name of God

Justifying violence
Citing from the Holy Book
Teaching hatred in the name of God

Listen
When the prophet speaks to you
Killing
In the name of God

Passion
Twisting faith into
Violence
In the name of God

In the name of God

Religious beliefs, fanatic obsession
Does following faith lead us to violence
Unyielding crusade, divine revelation
Does following faith lead us to violence
