Oh, when I get old
I'll be looking back, wishing it could last forever
Oh, yesterday
Seems so far away

Long dress, no shoes
Summer nights, golden and blue
It feels just like we're stuck inside a picture frame
These memories never fade away, oh

Whisper to me, we got the world
Right at our feet
And I just wanna sit right here and look at you
That's probably all I ever do

Oh, when I get old
I'll be looking back, wishing it could last forever
Oh, yesterday seems so far away

Where did it go?
All of the nights
All the time we spent together
Oh, yesterday
Seems so far a-

Wake up and smile, 'cause you're beautiful
Those hazel eyes
When I get old, that's all I wanna think about
I probably shouldn't say this out loud

High hopes, big dreams
And a little scared
Way too na√Øve, thinking you always be mine
And never leave my side
At least these memories never say goodbye

Oh, when I get old, I'll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
Oh, yesterday seems so far away

Where did it go?
All of the nights, all the time we spent together
Oh, yesterday seems so far away

Someday, I'm running out of time
I'll see your picture in my mind
I'll keep our love frozen in time

Oh, when I get old, I'll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
Oh, yesterday seems so far away
Where did it go?
All of the nights, all the time we spent together
Oh, yesterday seems so far away
