BLACKPINK in your area

보란 듯이 무너졌어
바닥을 뚫고 저 지하까지
옷 끝자락 잡겠다고
저 높이 두 손을 뻗어 봐도

다시 캄캄한 이곳에 light up the sky
네 두 눈을 보며, I'll kiss you goodbye
실컷 비웃어라 꼴 좋으니까
이제 너희, 하나, 둘, 셋

Ha, how you like that?
You gon' like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that
How you like that? (Bada-bing, bada-boom-boom-boom)
How you like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that?

Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me
Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?
Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me
Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?

Your girl need it all and that's a hunnid
백 개 중에 백, 내 몫을 원해
Karma come and get some
딱하지만 어쩔 수 없잖아
What's up? I'm right back (right back)
방아쇠를 cock back (cock back)
Plain Jane get hijacked, don't like me?
Then tell me how you like that, like that

더 캄캄한 이곳에 shine like the stars
그 미소를 띠며, I'll kiss you goodbye
실컷 비웃어라 꼴 좋으니까
이제 너희, 하나, 둘, 셋

Ha, how you like that?
You gon' like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that
How you like that? (Bada-bing, bada-boom-boom-boom)
How you like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that?

Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me
Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?
Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me
Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?

날개 잃은 채로 추락했던 날
어두운 나날 속에 갇혀 있던 날
그때쯤에 넌 날 끝내야 했어
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane

Yeah-eh-eh-eh
Bring out your boss, bitch
Yeah-eh-eh-eh
BLACKPINK!

뚜뚜뚜뚜두두, 뚜뚜뚜뚜두두 (how you like that?)
뚜뚜뚜뚜두두, 뚜뚜뚜뚜두두두 (you gon' like that)
뚜뚜뚜뚜두두, 뚜뚜뚜뚜두두 (how you like that?)
뚜뚜뚜뚜두두, 뚜뚜뚜뚜두두두
