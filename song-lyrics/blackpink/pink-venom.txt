Kick in the door, waving the coco'
팝콘이나 챙겨 껴들 생각 말고
I talk that talk, runways I walk-walk
눈 감고, pop-pop, 안 봐도 척

One by one, then two by two
내 손끝 툭 하나에 다 무너지는 중
가짜 쇼 치곤 화려했지
Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar out of me

자, 오늘 밤이야, 난 독을 품은 꽃
네 혼을 빼앗은 다음, look what you made us do
천천히 널 잠재울 fire
잔인할 만큼 아름다워 (I bring the pain like)

This that pink venom, this that pink venom
This that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
Straight to ya dome like whoa-whoa-whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah-ah-ah
Taste that pink venom, taste that pink venom
Taste that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
Straight to ya dome like whoa-whoa-whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah-ah-ah

Black paint and ammo', got bodies like Rambo
Rest in peace, please, light up a candle
This the life of a vandal, masked up, and I'm still in CELINE
Designer crimes, or it wouldn't be me, ooh!
Diamonds shining, drive in silence, I don't mind it, I'm riding
Flying private side by side with the pilot up in the sky
And I'm wyling, styling on them and there's no chance
'Cause we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance

자, 오늘 밤이야, 난 독을 품은 꽃
네 혼을 빼앗은 다음, look what you made us do
천천히 널 잠재울 fire
잔인할 만큼 아름다워 (I bring the pain like)

This that pink venom, this that pink venom
This that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
Straight to ya dome like whoa-whoa-whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah-ah-ah
Taste that pink venom, taste that pink venom
Taste that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
Straight to ya dome like whoa-whoa-whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah-ah-ah

원한다면 provoke us
감당 못해 and you know this
이미 퍼져버린 shot that potion
네 눈앞은 핑크빛 ocean
Come and give me all the smoke
도 아니면 모 like I'm so rock and roll
Come and give me all the smoke
다 줄 세워 봐, 자, stop, drop (I bring the pain like)

라타타타, 트라타타타
라타타타, 트라타타타
라타타타, 트라타타타
Straight to ya, straight to ya, straight to ya dome like
라타타타, 트라타타타 (BLACKPINK)
라타타타, 트라타타타 (BLACKPINK)
라타타타, 트라타타타 (BLACKPINK)
I bring the pain like-
