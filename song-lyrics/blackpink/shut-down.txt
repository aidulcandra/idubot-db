BLACKPINK in your area, eh-oh
BLACKPINK in your area, eh-oh

컴백이 아냐, 떠난 적 없으니까
고개들이 돌아, 진정해, 목 꺾일라
분홍빛의 얼음 drip, drip, drip, freeze 'em on sight
Shut it down, what-what-what-what?
게임이 아냐, 진 적이 없으니까
짖어봐, 네 목에 목줄은 내 거니까
땅바닥에 닿은 pedal, we go two-zero-five
Shut it down, uh-uh-uh-uh

초록 비를 내려 머리 위로, don't trip, baby
겸손하게 그냥 앉아있어, just sit, baby
Praying for my downfall, many have tried, baby
Catch me when you hear my Lamborghini
Go, vroom-vroom-vroom-vroom

When we pull up, you know it's a shutdown
간판 내리고 문 잠가 shutdown
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
It's black, and it's pink once the sun down

When we pull up, you know it's a shutdown
간판 내리고 문 잠가 shut down
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Keep watching me shut you down

Nah, you don't wanna be on my bad side
That's right, I'm slidin' through
Bunch of wannabes that wanna be me
Me three if I was you
Been around the world, pearls on ya, girl
VVS's we invested, uh
Need a lesson, see the necklace, see these dresses
We don't buy it, we request it, uh

A rock star, a pop star, but rowdier
Say bye to the paparazzi
Get my good side, I'll smile for ya
Know it ain't fair to ya, it's scarin' ya like what now?
BLACKPINK in your area, the area been shut down
It's a shutdown

네, 다음 답안지야, 똑바로 봐, don't sleep, baby
뒤집어봐, 이건 가격표야 ain't cheap, baby
Stay in your own lane 'cause I'm 'bout to swerve
Catch me when you hear my Lamborghini
Go, vroom-vroom-vroom-vroom

When we pull up, you know it's a shutdown
간판 내리고 문 잠가 shut down
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
It's black, and it's pink once the sun down

When we pull up, you know it's a shutdown
간판 내리고 문 잠가 shut down
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Keep watching me shut you down

Shut it down (eh-oh), BLACKPINK in your area
Shut it down (eh-oh), what-what-what-what?
Shut it down (eh-oh), BLACKPINK in your area
Keep talking, we shut you down
