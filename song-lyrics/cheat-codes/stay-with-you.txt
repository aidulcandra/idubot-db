Yeah, I know, know I'm scared of commitment
But tell me who isn't, tell me who isn't
I know, it's easier being alone

But when you come over again
I'm not gonna pretend I want anyone else 'cause I don't
I'm tired of being alone

I wanna stay with you, you, you
Make love all day with you, you, you
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through
I wanna stay with you, you, you
Make love all day with you, you, you
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through
I wanna stay with

Stay with, with

So let's start where we left
We can lay in my bed but we won't go to bed
No we won't
I'm not one for taking it slow

So when you come again and again
With the sheets in your hand
You can't even pretend that you don't
Love how I make you moan

I wanna stay with you, you, you
Make love all day with you, you, you
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through
I wanna stay with you, you, you
Make love all day with you, you, you
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through
I wanna stay with

Stay with, with
Ooh, stay
Stay with

Stay with you
Stay with you
Stay with you
I'm not looking for something new

I wanna stay with you, you, you
Make love all day with you, you, you
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through
I wanna stay with you, yeah

Stay with, with
Ooh, stay
Stay with you
Ooh, with you
