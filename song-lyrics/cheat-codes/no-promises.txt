Cutting me up like a knife
And I feel it, deep in my bones
Kicking a habit I love even harder
You wanna know?

I just wanna dive in the water, with you
Baby, we can't see the bottom
It's so easy to fall for each other
I'm just hoping we catch one another (another)

Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises

Baby, I think about you
And I feel it, deep in my heart (deep in my heart)
Maybe we just ain't meant to be something
Maybe we are, ooh?

I just wanna dive in the water, with you
Baby, we can't see the bottom
It's so easy to fall for each other
I'm just hoping we catch one another (another)

Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises, oh

I just wanna dive in the water
Oh baby, we can't see the bottom
I just want to dive in with you
I just want to lie here with you, oh

Oh na na, just be careful, na na (yeah)
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises (promise me)
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises, no

Promise me no promises
Don't you promise me nothing
Promise me, me, me, me
Just be careful
Promise me no promises
