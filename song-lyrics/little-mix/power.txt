Hold up, no, you didn't bow, bow
I ain't the chick to walk behind you 'round town
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby

Oh, I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down

Baby, you're the man
But I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain
But I make it, I make it, I make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, long as you don't forget

Who got the power?
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
Hold up!
(My turn)

I make this look easy, tick Tick, boom, like gasoline-y
Yeah, they call me Lamborghini, 'cause I know just what I'm worth
Z-z-z-zero to a hunnid, b-b-body make' em stutter
Start my engine, push the button, 'cause I'm gon' be coming first

Yeah, I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down

Baby, you're the man
But I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain
But I make it, I make it, I make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, long as you don't forget

Who got the power?
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power

Who got the power?
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power

Who got the power?

Don't be fooled, I got you wrapped up
In the arms of an animal
Get you thinking that I'm all innocent
But wait 'til I get you home
If you don't, baby, you should know
I'm the one who's in control

Motorbike, motorbike, motorbike, motorbike
Bike, bike, bike, bike
Bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, whoop

You're the man
But I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain
But I make it, I make it, I make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, long as you don't forget

You're the man
But I got, I got, I got the power
You make rain
But I make it, I make it, I make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
