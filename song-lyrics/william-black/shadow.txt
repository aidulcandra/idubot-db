Wrote a song so long ago
About a woman I never known
Long hair and deep blue eyes
I asked her name and she walked on by

But I'm still wondering, stumbling around
No one never hears me screaming out
Might as well just walk around the town, yeah

And now my shadow walks right by my side
Only friend that I'ma see tonight
Wonder if I'll let her see the sign, yeah

But she's gotta hold on to me
And she took the soul out of me
I don't wanna, I don't wanna go, I don't wanna leave

I don't wanna be better on my own
I don't wanna go, I can never leave
But I really think you're better off alone

Better off alone

And now my drinking days are over
I promise l'd be sober
And I hope I see you this time around

That's why my shadow walks right by my side
Only friend that I'ma see tonight
Wonder if I'll let her see the sign, yeah

But she's gotta hold on to me
And she took the soul out of me
I don't wanna, I don't wanna go, I don't wanna leave

I don't wanna be better on my own
I don't wanna go, I can never leave
But I really think you're better off alone

Better off alone

Better off alone
