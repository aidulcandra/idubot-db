We let the waters rise
We drifted to survive
I needed you to stay
But I let you drift away

My love, where are you?
My love, where are you?

Whenever you're ready, whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready, whenever you're ready
Can we, can we surrender?
Can we, can we surrender?
I surrender

No one will win this time
I just want you back
I'm running to your side
Flying my white flag, my white flag

My love, where are you?
My love, where are you?

Whenever you're ready, whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready, whenever you're ready
Can we, can we surrender?
Can we, can we surrender?
I surrender
Ooh-ooh-oh, oh-oh
I surrender
