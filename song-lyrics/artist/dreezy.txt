Yo
Yo
Yo
Yeah

Yo, I get decent off his yayo
That white girl keep them bills out the mail
I'm in a whip that look like mayo
Got all the boys on the block yelling, "ayo!"
I'm the one who all these bitches wanna be
Thirsty niggas, I just give 'em Aquafina
If I see anybody talkin' shit, I'm swingin'
I'm in the club, throwin' racks like I'm Serena

You was hot, I guess the summer up
I run the game, you just a runner-up
I got a boy but want another one
You might just have to get that cover up
Keep my bitch with me, that's how I'm rockin'
Dropped out of college but I'm still a topic
He bank with Chase, so I'm gon' run his pockets
I got my check up, ain't no window shoppin'

Yo, I get decent off his yayo
That white girl keep them bills out the mail
I'm in a whip that look like mayo
Got all the boys on the block yelling, "ayo!"
I'm the one who all these bitches wanna be
Thirsty niggas, I just give 'em Aquafina
If I see anybody talkin' shit, I'm swingin'
I'm in the club, throwin' racks like I'm Serena

Dreezy, what up?
I pull up, cut up
These bitches know that they can't fuck with us
Got choppers and uppercuts
How you want it? Bitch, sum it up
Bitches mad cause I got the upper hand
I'm in upperclass, don't want to fuck your man
Nigga's dusty
I'm in the Chi lookin' for Durk, tell him I got on my buffies
They tell me they love me, but I never trust 'em
I got my own bag, I don't need your money
I don't need shit from you, I'm livin' so lovely
I'm lookin' so cute, but shit can get so ugly
So run up on me
Fuck callin' cousins and callin' brothers
I'm pullin' cards, I'm pullin' numbers, nigga
Like ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball

Yo, I get decent off his yayo
That white girl keep them bills out the mail
I'm in a whip that look like mayo
Got all the boys on the block yelling, "ayo!"

No lie, I'm turnt up (drunk as fuck, though)
Got that skunk, rollin' blunts in the cut (I'm getting high)
I see you bitches actin' tough (for what, though?)
Don't make me pop the trunk (don't make me do it)
Ain't got no engine in the front (you ain't see it)
He wanna fuck, read his mind like I'm Avant (I know)
Got a sack, so I stunt
I've been up, ain't been asleep in 'bout a month

Yo, I get decent off his yayo
That white girl keep them bills out the mail
I'm in a whip that look like mayo
Got all the boys on the block yelling, "ayo!"
I'm the one who all these bitches wanna be
Thirsty niggas, I just give 'em Aquafina
If I see anybody talkin' shit, I'm swingin'
I'm in the club, throwin' racks like I'm Serena
