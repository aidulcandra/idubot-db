Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, shit, yeah
Late night, thinkin' of shit, um (yeah)
(Tell me why)
Tell me why, tell me why
It's so hard to say goodbye, shit
Tell me why, tell me why
(No, no, no, no)
Oh shit, let's go (yeah, yeah)

Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (shit)
And when I get inside of my mind, I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye

Lost too many people to this shit, can't even speak upon this shit
I seen shit, I'm way too damn young, it shouldn't need to be like this
I swear that I'm way too damn numb to even think about this shit
But when it's late and I lay awake, I get to tweakin' in this bitch
Overthinkin', overdrinkin' Hennessy up in this bitch
And I'ma face another 'wood 'til I can't think up in this bitch
'Cause if I keep thinking 'bout our memories
Then it's gon' be in memory of me

Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (shit)
And when I get inside of my mind, I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (shit)

I can't count all the tears I cried, so many sleepless nights
Watch all of my idols die, right in front of my eyes
She asked why my heart so cold, and I just can't even lie
I think that I'm better off, without you with me tonight
Better off alone, 'cause I won't take you where I live
You come in my life, just to go like the rest did
Why the fuck does God keep testing me?
Put my heart to bed, let it rest in peace, yeah

Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (shit)
And when I get inside of my mind, I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah

Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah
And when I get inside of my mind, I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah
