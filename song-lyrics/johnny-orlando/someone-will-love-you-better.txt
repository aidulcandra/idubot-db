The greatest romance, lightning strike to my heart
We would slow dance, in the headlights, in the parking lot
There was no chance of ever falling apart
But you've noticed that I'm here, but I'm so far

'Cause I've been running from the sun
And I've got nowhere left to hide (oh)

Every night I close my eyes
And wish I was still in love
Trying to fight, at war with my mind
It's gonna kill me to give you up
Darling, this is gonna hurt
No, I won't regret it
'Cause I loved you first
But someone will love you better

Last time I hold you
Just 'cause you needed heart to console you
When I can't give you reasons
Hate that love can be a thing you lose
There's nothing you or I could do
We were fools to fall and it's nobody's fault, no

'Cause I've been running from the sun
And I've got nowhere left to hide

Every night I close my eyes
And wish I was still in love
Trying to fight, at war with my mind
It's gonna kill me to give you up
Darling, this is gonna hurt
No, I won't regret it
'Cause I loved you first
But someone will love you better

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ah
'Cause I loved you first (I loved you first)
But someone will love you better
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ah
'Cause I loved you first
But someone will love you better

Darling, this is gonna hurt
I won't regret it
'Cause I loved you first
But someone will love you better
