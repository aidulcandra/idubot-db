Well, I have a home, longing to roam
I have to find you, I have to meet you
Signs of your face, slowing your pace
I need your guidance, I need to seek my

My pupils dance, lost in a trance
Your sacred silence, losing all violence
Stars in their place mirror your face
I need to find you, I need to seek my

The road that leads to all leads to one
There's only one true path in life (innervision)
The road that leads to all (innervision)
Innervision

Your sacred silence, losing all violence
