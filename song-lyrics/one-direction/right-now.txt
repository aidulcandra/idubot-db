Lights go down, and the night is calling to me, yeah
I hear voices singing songs in the street
And I know that we won't be going home for so long, for so long
But I know that I won't be on my own, yeah
I love this feeling and

Right now
I wish you were here with me (Oh-ooh)
'Cause right now
Everything is new to me (Oh-ooh)
You know I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now
I wish you were here with me (Oh-ooh)

Late night spaces
With all our friends, you and me, yeah
Love these faces
Just like how it used to be
And we won't be going home
For so long, for so long
But I know, I won't be on my own
On my own, I'm feeling like

Right now
I wish you were here with me (Oh-ooh)
'Cause right now
Everything is new to me (Oh-ooh)
You know I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now
I wish you were here with me (Oh-ooh)

And I could do this forever (Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)
And let's go crazy together (Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)
Lights go down, and
I hear you calling to me, yeah

Right now
I wish you were here with me (Oh-ooh)
'Cause right now
Everything is new to me (Oh-ooh)
You know I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now
I wish you were here with me (Oh-ooh)
