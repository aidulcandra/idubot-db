You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else, but you, ooh

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe

You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else, but you, ooh

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe

You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
Na-na-na, na-na-na

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
(You don't know, oh-oh)
You don't know you're beautiful

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe

You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful
