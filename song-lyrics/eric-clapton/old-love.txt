I can feel your body
When I'm lying in my bed
There's too much confusion
Going 'round through my head

And it's making me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Lord, why can't I get over?
And when will I ever learn?

Old love
Leave me alone
Old love
Just go on home

I can see your face, yes
But I know it ain't real
Just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

And it's making me so angry
I know now that the flame will always burn
They will always burn
I ain't never gonna get over
Knowin' that I'll never learn
Never learn

Old love, old love
Leave me alone
Old love, old love
Just go on home
Go on home

Old love
Just go on home
Go on home

Old love
Old love
Ooh love
Ooh love
Old love
Old love
Old love
