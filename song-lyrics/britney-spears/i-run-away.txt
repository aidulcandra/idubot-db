You took your love away too fast
Left no chance to say, "Look back"
And now I know the truth, it makes it easier
Maybe when time goes by, I'll understand

Lets pretend that I've moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away

You threw it all away
So blind (So blind)
You pushed me far from you in your life
Now I know the tears won't lead to lonliness
Maybe when time goes by, I'll understand

Lets pretend that I've moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away

I run away
I run away
I run away

Lets pretend that I've moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away
Lets pretend that I've moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away

Let's pretend that I've moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
