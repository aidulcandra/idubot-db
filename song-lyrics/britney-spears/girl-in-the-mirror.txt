There's a girl in my mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did

There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes
When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken, easily
'Cause the girl in my mirror is cryin' tonight

And there's nothing I can tell her to make her feel alright
Oh, the girl in my mirror is cryin' 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do
If I could, I would tell her

Not to be afraid
The pain that's she feeling
The sense of loneliness will fade
So dry your tears and rest assured

Love will find you like before
When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily
'Cause the girl in my mirror is cryin' tonight

And there's nothing I can tell her to make her feel alright
Oh, the girl in my mirror is cryin' 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh, I wish there was something I could do
I can't believe it's what I see
That the girl in the mirror

The girl in the mirror is me
I can't believe what I see, no, oh
Oh, the girl in my mirror

The girl in my mirror, is me
Oh, is me
'Cause the girl in my mirror is cryin' tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her to make her feel alright
Oh, the girl in my mirror is cryin' 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh, I wish there was something I could do
