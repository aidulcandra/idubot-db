You can say hello
To the man with no soul
You can walk right by him
And HeÂ´ll take you home
Down the same road
That you always roam
To the same old places
That you always go
See the same old faces
You already know
In the same bad graces
That youÂ´ve always known
Send the same old message
That you set in stone
But it donÂ´t mean nothing
When youÂ´re on your own
I fight to see
For what I believe
But all this doubt
Is killing me
So this is it
I never quit
The fear overcoming
Goodbye
Say goodbye to the knife
That you sharpen with your life
Say goodbye
To the dark side
Goodbye
Say goodbye to the lies
And the pain
You hold inside
Say goodbye to that old life
Goodbye
Time to step it up
ItÂ´s time to shine
I can feel it creeping
Up my spine
Time to set it straight
So hereÂ´s your sign
IÂ´m gonna take it all
Cause you know itÂ´s mine
IÂ´m gonna spend it all
And itÂ´s on your dime
IÂ´m gonna break you all
And IÂ´ll feel just fine
IÂ´m gonna take the fall
If I fit the crime
And yeah I fit the crime
I fight to see
For what I believe
But all this doubt
Is killing me
So this is it
I never quit
The fear overcoming
Goodbye
Say goodbye to the knife
That you sharpen with your life
Say goodbye
To the dark side
Goodbye
Say goodbye to the lies
And the pain
You hold inside
Say goodbye to that old life
Goodbye
Gone are the days of old
Lost are the lies weÂ´re told
Now I can realize
IÂ´m glad to say goodbye
Look to the times ahead
Breath like itÂ´s your dying breath
Fell like you never fell
Be glad to say goodbye
Goodbye
Say goodbye to the knife
That you sharpen with your life
Say goodbye
To the dark side
Goodbye
Say goodbye to the lies
And the pain
You hold inside
Say goodbye to that old life
Goodbye
Goodbye
(Goodbye)
Goodbye
(Goodbye)
Goodbye
Now you know that
This is goodbye
Goodbye
Now you know that
This is goodbye
Goodbye
