I hear the flower's kinda crying loud
The breeze is sounding sad
Oh no
Tell me when did we become
So cold and empty inside
Lost a way long time ago
Did we really turn out blind
We don't see that we keep hurting each other no
All we do is just fight

Now we share the same bright sun
The same round moon
Why don't we share the same love
Tell me why not
Life is shorter than most have thought

Hold my hand
There are many ways to do it right
Hold my hand
Turn around and see what we have left behind
Hold my hand my friend
We can save the good spirit of me and you
For another chance
And let's pray for a beautiful world
A beautiful world I share with you

Children seem like they've lost their smile
On the new blooded playgrounds
Oh no
How could we ignore, heartbreaking crying sounds
And we're still going on
Like nobody really cares
And we just stopped feeling all the pain because
Like it's a daily basic affair

Now we share the same bright sun
The same round moon
Why don't we share the same love
Tell me why not
Life is shorter than most have thought

Hold my hand
There are many ways to do it right
Hold my hand
Turn around and see what we have left behind
Hold my hand my friend
We can save the good spirit of me and you
For another chance
And let's pray for a beautiful world
A beautiful world I share with you

No matter how far I might be
I'm always gonne be your neighbour
There's only one small planet where to be
So I'm always gonna be your neighbour
We cannot hide, we can't deny
That we're always gonna be neighbours
You're neighbour, my neighbour
We're neighbours

So hold my hand
There are many ways to do it right
Hold my hand
Turn around and see what have left behind

Hold my hand
There are many ways to do it right
Hold my hand
Turn around and see what have left behind
Hold my hand my friend
We can save the good spirit of me and you
For another chance
And let's pray for a beautiful world
A beautiful world I share with you
