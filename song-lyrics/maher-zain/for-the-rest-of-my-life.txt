I praise Allah for sending me you my love
You found me home and sail with me
And I'm here with you
Now let me let you know
You've opened my heart
I was always thinking that love was wrong
But everything was changed when you came along
Ohohoh
And there's a couple of words I want to say

For the Rest of My Life
I'll be with you
I'll stay by your side honest and true
Till the end of my time
I'll be loving you. loving you
For the Rest of My Life
Through days and nights
I'll thank Allah for opening my eyes
Now and forever I, I'll be there for you

I know it deep in my heart
I feel so blessed when I think of you
And I ask Allah to bless all we do
You're my wife and my friend and my strength
And I pray we're together in Jana
Now I find myself I feel so strong
Everything has changed when you came along
Ohohoh
And there's a couple of words I want to say

For the Rest of My Life
I'll be with you
I'll stay by your side honest and true
Till the end of my time
I'll be loving you. loving you
For the Rest of My Life
Through days and nights
I'll thank Allah for opening my eyes
Now and forever I, I'll be there for you

I know it deep in my heart
Now that you're here
In front of me I strongly feel love
And I have no doubt
And I'm singing loud that I'll love you eternally

For the Rest of My Life
I'll be with you
I'll stay by your side honest and true
Till the end of my time
I'll be loving you.loving you
