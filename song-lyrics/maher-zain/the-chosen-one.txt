In a time of darkness and greed
It is your light that we need
You came to teach us how to live
Muhammad Ya Rasool Allah
You were so caring and kind
Your soul was full of light
You are the best of mankind
Muhammad Khaira Khalqillah

Sallu 'ala Rasulillah, Habib Al Mustafa
Peace be upon The Messenger
The Chosen One
From luxury you turned away

And all night you would pray
Truthful in every word you say
Muhammad Ya Rasul Allah
Your face was brighter than the sun
Your beauty equaled by none
You are Allah Chosen One
Muhammad Khaira Khalqillah
Sallu 'ala Rasulillah, Habib Al Mustafa

Peace be upon The Messenger
The Chosen One
I will try to follow your way
And do my best to live my life

As you taught me
I pray to be close to you
On that day and see you smile
When you see me
Sallu 'ala Rasulillah, Habibil Mustafa
Peace be upon The Messenger
The Chosen One
Sallu 'ala Rasulillah, Habibi Mustafa
Peace be upon The Messenger
The Chosen One
Sallu 'ala Rasulillah
Peace be upon
The Chosen One
