Look around your self
Can't you see this wonder
Spread in front of you
The clouds floating by
The sky so clear and blue
Planets in their orbits
The moon and the sun
Such perfect harmony

Let's start questioning ourselves
Isn't this proof enough for us
Or are we so blind to push it all aside
No, we just have to

Open our eyes, our hearts and minds
If we just look right, we'll see the signs
We can't keep hiding from the truth
And let it take us by surprise
Allah protect us in the best way
Allah guide us every single day
Allah keep us close to You
Until the end of time

Look inside your self
Such perfect order
Hiding in your cells
Running in your veins
What about anger, love, and pain?
And all the things you're feeling
Can you touch them with your hand?
So are they really there?
Let's start questioning ourselves
Isn't this proof enough for us
Or are we so blind to push it all aside
No, we just have to

Open our eyes, our hearts and minds
If we just look right, we'll see the signs
We can't keep hiding from the truth
And let it take us by surprise
Allah protect us in the best way
Allah guide us every single day
Allah keep us close to You
Until the end of time

When a baby is born
So helpless and weak
And you're watching it growing
Why deny what's in front of your eyes
The biggest miracle of life
We just have to

Open our eyes, our hearts and minds
If we just look right, we'll see the signs
We can't keep hiding from the truth
And let it take us by surprise
Allah protect us in the best way
Allah guide us every single day
Allah keep us close to You
Until the end of time

Open our eyes, our hearts and minds
If we just look right, we'll see the signs
We can't keep hiding from the truth
And let it take us by surprise
Allah protect us in the best way
Allah guide us every single day
Allah keep us close to You
Until the end of time

Allah You created everything
We belong to You
Ya Rabb we raise our hands
Forever we thank you
Allhamdulillah
