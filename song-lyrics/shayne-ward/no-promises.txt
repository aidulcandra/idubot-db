Hey baby when we are together
Doing things that we love
Every time your near I feel like I'm in heaven
Feeling high
I don't want to let go girl
I just need you to know girl

I don't wanna run away
Baby,your the one I need tonight
No promises
Baby, now I need to hold you tight
I just wanna die in your arms
Hear tonight
