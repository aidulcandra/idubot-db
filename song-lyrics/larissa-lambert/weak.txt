I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do, when you do, what you doing
Oh, no, no
It's a feeling that I want to stay

'Cause my heart starts beatin' a triple times
With thoughts of lovin' you on my mind
But I can't figure out just so what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In the days, your love's so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me
By my side, I'll swallow all of my pride
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet
Yeah, yeah
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

Time after time, after time, I try to fight it, yeah
But your love is strong, and it keeps on holdin' on
The system is down, when you're around, I try to fight it, hey
In my condition, I don't wanna be alone

'Cause my heart starts beatin' a triple times
With thoughts of lovin' you on my mind
But I can't figure out just so what to do
When the cause and cure is you, you

I get weak in the knees, I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me (lose control, over me)
In the days, your love's so amazing (amazing)
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me (stay with me)
By my side, I'll swallow all of my pride
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
