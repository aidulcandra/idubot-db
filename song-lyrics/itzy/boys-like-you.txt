Why you calling me up saying sorry again
Already told you weâ€™re done
What didnâ€™t you get?
Donâ€™t forget youâ€™re the one
that tried to get with my friends
the end the end the end the end
Well you must be going crazy
thinking Iâ€™ll be back, Iâ€™m sorry
Cause youâ€™re crying like a baby
but do I look like your mommy?
Take a look into that mirror
if u wonder why u lost me
gotta sit down and shut up
you did it to yourself
Boy, gonna diss me? Boy, Iâ€™m so pissed
Boy, gonna miss me, Boy, you are dismissed
Cuz I donâ€™t fall for boys like you (I donâ€™t fall for)
I donâ€™t fall for boys like you (I donâ€™t fall for)
Boy, wanna date me? Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, wanna â€œWhat? No!â€ Boy, outta my way
Cuz I donâ€™t fall for boys like you (I donâ€™t fall for)
I donâ€™t fall for boys like you (I donâ€™t fall for)
I see through sweet little lies and every excuse
when you start every fight, the blame is on you
one red flag and Iâ€™m gone already onto
the next the next the next
well you must be going crazy
thinking Iâ€™ll be back, Iâ€™m sorry
cause youâ€™re crying like a baby
but do I look like your mommy?

You can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
