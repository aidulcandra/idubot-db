Ev'ry one can see
There's a change in me
They all say I'm not the same
Kid I used to be
Don't go out and play
I just dream all day
They don't know what's wrong whit me
And I'm too shy to say
It's my first love
What I'm dreamin' of
When I go to bed
When I lay my head upon my pillow
Don't know what to do
My first love
Thinks that I'm too young
He doesn't even know
Wish that I could show him
What I'm feelin'
'cause I'm feelin' my first love
(instrumental)
Mirror on the wall
Does he care at all
Will he ever notice me
Could he ever fall
Tell me teddy bear
Why love is so unfair
Will I ever find a way
An answer to my prayer
For my first love
What I'm dreamin' of
When I go to bed
When I lay my head upon my pillow
Don't know what to do
My first love
Thinks that I'm to young
He doesn't even know
Wish that I could show him what I'm feelin'
'cause I'm feelin' my first love
My first love
