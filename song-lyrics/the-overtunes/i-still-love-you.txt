If someday your feet can't touch the ground
If someday your arms can't feel my touch

If someday your eyes can't see my face
I'll carry you be there for you anytime of day

Forever is a long time but I keep my words that I save to you
Together we can go far as long as I'm with you

Cause I will fall for you no matter what they say
I still love you I still love you
You'll never be alone now look me in the eyes
I still love you I still love you
Till forever

If one day you don't recognize my voice
If one day you seems so hard to breath

I'll promise you to give my all
Ooh like you do from the day I start to see

Forever is a long time but I keep my words that I save to you
Together we can go far as long as you are with me

Cause I will fall for you no matter what they say
I still love you I still love you
You'll never be alone now look me in the eyes
I still love you I still love you
Till forever

I'll keep you safe until you find what you looking for, looking for
I'll stay with you until you find your way back home, way back home

I'll keep you safe until you find what you looking for, looking for
I'll stay with you until you find your way back home, way back home

Cause I will fall for you no matter what they say
I still love you I still love you
You'll never be alone now look me in the eyes
I still love you I still love you
I still love you

Now see me through my skin
Your heart is stays within
I still love you
