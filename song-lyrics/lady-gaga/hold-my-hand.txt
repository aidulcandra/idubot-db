To tell me you need me

Hold my hand, everything will be okay
I heard from the heavens that clouds have been gray
Pull me close, wrap me in your aching arms
I see that you're hurting, why'd you take so long

To tell me you need me? I see that you're bleeding
You don't need to show me again
But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you
I won't let go 'til the end

So, cry tonight
But don't you let go of my hand
You can cry every last tear
I won't leave 'til I understand
Promise me, just hold my hand

Raise your head, look into my wishful eyes
That fear that's inside you will lift, give it time
I can see everything you're blind to now
Your prayers will be answered, let God whisper how

To tell me you need me, I see that you're bleeding
You don't need to show me again
But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you
I won't let go 'til the end

So, cry tonight
But don't you let go of my hand
You can cry every last tear
I won't leave 'til I understand
Promise you'll just hold my hand

Hold my hand, hold my-
Hold my hand, my hand
I'll be right here, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my-
Hold my hand, my hand
I'll be right here, hold my hand

I know you're scared and your pain is imperfect
But don't you give up on yourself
I've heard a story, a girl, she once told me
That I would be happy again

Hold my hand, yeah
Hold my hand, oh yeah
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Hold my hand

I heard from the heavens
