Midnight, and I'm a-waitin' on the twelve-oh-five
Hopin' it'll take me just a little farther down the line
Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breakin'
If it's only for a very short time?

Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody tellin' everybody what you have done?
Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handin' out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some

Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm goin' through
And it's a-hard to be a lover
When you say you're only in it for fun

Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you

Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
And knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
