I am finding out that maybe I was wrong
That I've fallen down and I can't do this alone
Stay with me
This is what I need please

Sing us a song
And we'll sing it back to you
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you

I am nothing now
And its been so long
Since I've heard a sound
The sound of my only hope
This time I will be listening

Sing us a song
And we'll sing it back to you
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you

This heart, it beats
Beats for only you

This heart, it beats
Beats for only you, oooh

this heart, it beats
Beats for only you
My heart is yours

This heart, it beats
Beats for only you
My heart is yours (my heart beats for you)

This heart, it beats
Beats for only you
My heart is yours

This heart, it beats (please don't go now)
Beats for only you (please don't go away)
My heart, my heart is yours (please don't go now, please don't go away)

my heart is yours
(Please don't go now, please don't fade away)
My heart is yours (please don't go, please don't fade away)
(Please don't go now, please don't fade away) my heart is
