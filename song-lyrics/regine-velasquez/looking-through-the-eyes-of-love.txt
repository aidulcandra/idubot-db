Please, don't let this feeling end
It's everything I am,
Everything I want to be;
I can see what's mine now
Finding out what's true,
Since I've found you
Lookin' through the eyes of love.
Now I can take the time,
I can see my life
As it comes up shining now;
Reachin' out to touch you,
I can feel so much,
Since I've found you
Lookin' through the eyes of love.
REFRAIN:
And now, I do believe,
That even in a storm, we'll find some light;
Knowin' you're beside me, I'm alright.
Please don't let this feelin end,
It might not come again;
And I want to remember
How it feels to touch you;
How I feel so much,
Since I've found you
Lookin' through the eyes of love.
CODA:
Reaching out to touch you,
I can feel so much,
Since I've found you
Lookin' through the eyes of love.
