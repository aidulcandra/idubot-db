Dream, dream, dream, dream

Hello, hello, hello
Can I hear an echo?
Purple, red and yellow
I can't wait to get home
Head down on the pillow
Holding you is all I think about

You're asleep in London
I wish you were coming
Back home to me, darling
You're too far away
Count back from one hundred
Holding you is all I think about

Oh baby
When I'm apart from you
I just shut my eyes
All I have to do

Is dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
(About you, about you, about you, about you)

Hello, hello, hello
Walking through a meadow
Full of sunflowers, picking off the pedals
I don't wanna wake up without you laying next to me
Yeah
I'm no good at waiting
All the separation
Feeling suffocated
I just need to breathe
And I'm starting to hate it
I can't wait to fall asleep

Oh baby
When I'm apart from you
I just close my eyes
And all I have to do

Is dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
(About you, about you, about you, about you)

Dream, dream, dream, dream (I dream about you)
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
(About you, about you, about you, about you)

Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
