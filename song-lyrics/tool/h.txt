What's coming through is alive
What's holding up is a mirror
But what's singing songs is a snake, it is
Looking to turn my piss to wine
They're both totally void of hate
And killing me just the same
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again
And I feel this coming over like a storm again
Considerately

Venomous voice, tempts me
And drains me, bleeds me
Leaves me cracked and empty
Drags me down like some sweet gravity

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again
And I feel this coming over like a storm again, now
And I feel this coming over like a storm again, now

I am too connected to you
To slip away, to fade away
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me
And considerately killing me
Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me

Without the skin, here beneath the storm
Under these tears, now
The walls came down
Once the snake is drowned and
As I look in his eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of those times
I could have cried then
I should have cried then
As the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
And will die
It's all right

I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

I am too connected to you
To slip away and fade away
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me
And considerately killing me
Considerately killing me, yeah
Considerately killing me
