Oh
How could you talk?
How could you switch up for me in my darkest hour?

What's the risk it happened? Rollin' with myself
I got too attached, now I'm workin' on my health
Wanna be a savage, thinkin' 'bout yourself
I had to attack, but to leave you on the shelf, oh well

Face facts for you, I lost my head
Face that, it's cool, we go again
Can't let these heartless broken boys win, no (can't let these heartless broken boys win)
I'm back, I'm on my shit again
Back to business, caught my fuel again
You out so, I can let me back in (so, I can let me back in)

Now, I'm, I'm in my ride
It's me, myself and time
This what it takes to break a heartache
I'm, I'm just gon' drive
Just me, myself and time
Before I lose my hope, I'm thinkin' "How?"

How could you talk?
How could you switch it up on me in my darkest hour?
(How could you?) How, how could you turn?
How could you switch it up on me? Yeah
Switch it up on me, yeah-yeah

What's the risk it happened? Rollin' with myself
I got too attached, now I'm workin' on my health
Wanna be a savage, thinkin' 'bout yourself
I had to attack, but to leave you on the shelf, oh well

How you switch up on a nigga?
I thought you would never leave
I know you hear my voice everywhere you be
Cold case, I had to give lil' shawty back to the streets
Had to slide out to Maui, I be back in two weeks
And it ain't no turnin' back, had to put her on the shelf
I can't buy a hunnid bags, gotta be loyal by yourself
And I can't reward disrespect, you know
Never give up soul ties, I rather have a hunnid hoes

I thought that you vowed to be a roller
You had the big champion, now it's game over
Still outside, still keepin' my composure
Still gettin' wired, still killin' 'til it's over

Now I'm (ay) I'm in my ride
It's me, myself and time
This what it takes to break a heartache
I'm (ay) I'm just gon' drive
Just me, myself and time
Before I lose my hope, I'm thinkin' "How?"

How could you talk?
How could you switch it up on me in my darkest hour?
(How could you?) How, how could you turn?
How could you switch it up on me? Yeah
Switch it up on me, yeah-yeah

What's the risk it happened? Rollin' with myself
I got too attached, now I'm workin' on my health
Wanna be a savage, thinkin' 'bout yourself
I had to attack, but to leave you on the shelf, oh well

My bad for puttin' my all in
Don't give me back what you stolen
How you actin', it's embarrassing as it get

What's the risk it happened? Rollin' with myself
I got too attached, now I'm workin' on my health
Wanna be a savage, thinkin' 'bout yourself
I had to attack, but to leave you on the shelf, oh well
