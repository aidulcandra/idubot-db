Sun kissed my face
Wishing for the real thing
Lonely and out of place
When I don't have you with me

Does your heart stay the same
On all these nights alone? Yeah
Or is it just me
Hoping you'll come home?

'Cause I don't know if I can make you happy
No matter what the odds, I'm gonna try
A million miles away, I feel you with me
For now, our love will live inside my mind

So, don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you
I feel your love every time I close my eyes
'Causе I finally found you

When the times are hardеst, I find you in the darkness
You're a dream and that is enough (that is enough), yeah
Don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Finally found you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Finally found you (found you)

Summer days so far away
Only see 'em in the rearview, yeah (rearview, yeah)
How will I hold you again
To make you feel at home?

'Cause I don't know if I can make you happy
No matter what the odds, I'm gonna try
A million miles away, I feel you with me (I feel you with me)
For now, our love will live inside my mind

So, don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you (found you)
I feel your love every time I close my eyes
'Cause I finally found you

When the times are hardest, I find you in the darkness
You're a dream and that is enough (that is enough), yeah
Don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Finally found you (yeah, I finally found)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Finally found you (yeah, I finally found you)

Don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you
