Went out the other night with all my friends
Started to feel like me again
Hadn't been that happy in a while
Had drinks and we put a sad song on
You're oh, so casually brought up
There goes my night and goes my smile

'Cause that was two full years of us down the drain
And I'm reminded that it all went to waste
And when my friends are asking if I miss you
What do I say?

If I don't laugh, I'm gonna cry
Don't wanna hear your name tonight
I'm finally happy, not in the mood
I don't wanna think about you
If I hear your name one more time
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Don't know what to do 'cause I'm not alright
But if I don't laugh, I'm gonna cry, cry

Made my way to the bathroom, nonchalant
'Cause I felt like tears were coming on
It's not what I planned for my big night out
Took me hours just to do my makeup right
If you're the reason it gets ruined, I'll be pissed tonight
Either way, mascara's running down

'Cause that was two full years of us down the drain
And I'm reminded that it all went to waste
And when my friends are asking if I miss you
What do I say?

If I don't laugh, I'm gonna cry
Don't wanna hear your name tonight
I'm finally happy, not in the mood
I don't wanna think about you
If I hear your name one more time
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Don't know what to do 'cause I'm not alright
But if I don't laugh, I'm gonna cry, cry

And I bet you're out with all your friends
Or maybe kissing someone new, and you don't have to pretend
Like you don't miss me
Like you don't miss me

If I don't laugh, I'm gonna cry
Don't wanna hear your name tonight
I'm finally happy, not in the mood
I don't wanna think about you
If I hear your name one more time
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Don't know what to do 'cause I'm not alright
But if I don't laugh, I'm gonna cry, cry
