Living all alone kinda forgot it's been that long
Since someone's gone
I've been trying to be a little bit strong
And it is not that easy to be exactly who I was
My shit is done
Now it's time for me try to moving on

'Cause if you think I'm such a happy person, no
You are wrong by saying my laughter is
Louder than yours, shut your freakin' mouth
No one knows what I feel and what I suffer
No they dont know, so keep your thoughts
And stop assuming that, someone is always fine

I keep thinking why my friends left me
I can go insane
Mom was right about that and now I can't trust again
But I think I don't really need no
Friends I'm alone and it's not that bad
Then again it hurts me so bad and people just don't know that
Maybe this time, I'ma take back what is mine
All the smiles, all the joys are still mine (are still mine)
There will be no more cryin'
There will be no more tryin'
These places I never belong
'Cause this guy now is gone

If you think I'm such a happy person, no
You are wrong by saying my laughter is
Louder than yours, shut your freakin mouth
No one knows what I feel and what I suffer
No they don't know, so keep your thoughts
And stop assuming that, someone is always fine

If you think I'm such a happy person, no
You are wrong by saying my laughter is
Louder than yours, shut your freakin mouth
No one knows what I feel and what I suffer
No they don't know
So keep your thoughts and stop assuming that, someone is always fine
