I'm always coming back to you

Some nights we fight, we scream
We don't know what to do
But I guess it's just the simple things
That people they go through

But another night the glimpse I see the real one that's you
And I know that nothing will stop me from standing I care
I'm always coming back to you
You've got me till the end
I'm always coming back to you
You keep pulling me in
I'm always coming back

Oh Woah
Time goes by yeah
Oh Woah
Time goes by

背を向ければ向けるほど愛しく
向き合うほど離れていきそうで
形のない不確かなものを探す
And I know that nothing can stop me from standing I care
I'm always coming back to you
You've got me till the end
I'm always coming back to you
You keep pulling me in
I'm always coming back

Oh Woah
Time goes by yeah
Oh Woah
Time goes by
Oh

明日もしも君がそこ居なくても
こわくないって言えるくるい強くなるよ
I gotta find the way and place to keep you here with me

Some night we fight, we scream
We don't know what to do
But I guess it's just the simple things
That people they go through

Oh Woah
Time goes by yeah
Oh Woah
Time goes by
Time
Time goes by
Oh Time
Time goes by

Some nights we fight we scream
We don't know what to do
But I guess it's just the normal things
That people they go through
