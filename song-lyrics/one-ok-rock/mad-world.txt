What would you say
If the whole world could hear it
What would you do
If you knew they would believe it

I need something real
And we don't care how you feel
I don't wanna give up
We will never give up

We got black mascara running
We want change but it ain't coming
Hanging by a thread
So close to the edge

We wanna beat that generation
But we can't live up to their expectations
Hanging by a thread
So close to the edge

Living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
Living in a mad

I cannot change
I'm proud of who I am
And this is how I stay
Don't care if you understand it

I need something real
And we don't care how you feel
I don't wanna give up
We will never give up

We got black mascara running
We want change but it ain't coming
Hanging by a thread
So close to the edge

We wanna (oh) beat that generation
But we can't live up to their expectations
Hanging (oh) by a thread
So close to the edge

Living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world

We got black mascara running
We want change but it ain't coming
Hanging by a thread
So close to the edge

We wanna (oh) beat that generation
But we can't live up to their expectations
Hanging (oh) by a thread
So close to the edge

What would you say
If the whole world could hear it
What would you do
If you knew they would believe it
