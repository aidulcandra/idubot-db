I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life

And I don't wanna go back
Never go back to where I was
God changed my way
Gave me a new heart
And I'll never be the same again
And you have my devotion forever
It's amazing that nothing would ever
Separate me from His love
My Creator from above

Who gave us life
Who gave us life
Who gave us life, yeah
Gave us life and that's why

I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life

Now, no stress, no strain
No pain, no gain
No, I'm not who I was
I'm not the same
And you're not to blame, no
Now, I don't complain
And from my past show no shame, no
'Cause we all been down that road before
Hoping one day we will explore
What's behind the golden door
They say your friends ain't family
You lost along the way, how can it be?
That you're here today and gone tomorrow
Nothing's here for certain, yes, that breath you take is borrowed

That's right
He gave us life
He gave us life, yeah
Gave us life and that's why

I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life

It's probably you, you already made up your mind
You ain't saying nothing because you already know
All about this business singing to you
You pray before you hit you
Rock your Jesus Christ spirit jokes
You heard it all, you've seen it all, you know it all
You go to church sometimes or you heard the stories before?
Well, that's all good, 'cause all I'm suggesting is that you get to know them lonely

I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life
