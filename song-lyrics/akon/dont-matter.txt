To always apologize (Apologize)

Got every right to want to leave (Wanna leave)
Got every right to want to go (Wanna go)
You got every right to hit the road (Hit the road)
And never talk to me no more (Me no more)
You don't even have to call (Have to call)
Or even check for me at all (Me at all)
Because the way I've been acting lately (I've been acting)
Has been off the wall (Off the wall)

Especially towards you (Towards you)
Putting girls before you (Before you)
And they watching everything I've been doing just to hurt you (Hurt you)
Most of it just ain't true (Ain't true)
And they won't show you (Show you)
