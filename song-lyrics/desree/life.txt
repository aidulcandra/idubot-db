Mmm-mm, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh life, oh life

I'm afraid of the dark
'Specially when I'm in a park
And there's no one else around
Ooh, I get the shivers
I don't want to see a ghost
It's a sight that I fear most
I'd rather have a piece of toast
And watch the evening news

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo doo doo doo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo doo doo

I'm a superstitious girl
I'm the worst in the world
Never walk under ladders
I keep a rabbit's tail
I'll take you up on a dare
Anytime, anywhere
Name the place, I'll be there
Bungee jumping, I don't care

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo doo doo doo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo doo doo
Life
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo

So after all is said and done
I know I'm not the only one
Life indeed can be fun
If you really want to
Sometimes living out your dreams
Ain't as easy as it seems
You wanna fly around the world
In a beautiful balloon

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo doo doo doo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo doo doo doo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo doo doo doo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Oh life, oh life

Oh life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Oh life, oh life, oh life, oh life
