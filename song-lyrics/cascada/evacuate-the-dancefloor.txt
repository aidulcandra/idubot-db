Turn up the music let's get out on the floor
I like to move it come and give me some more
Watch me getting physical, out of control (Ah-ha)
There's people watching me (ah-ha)
I never miss a beat

Still the night, kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight
'Cause it's pulling you in
Wrap it up you can't stop
'Cause it feels like an overdose (Feels like an overdose)

evacuate the dance floor
(Oh, oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Oh, oh) stop this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ let the music take me underground

evacuate the dance floor
(Oh, oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Oh, oh) stop this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ let the music take me underground

Temperature's rising, I'm about to explode
Watch me I'm intoxicated taking the show (ah-ha)
It's got me hypnotized (ah-ha)
Everybody step aside

Still the night, kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight
'Cause it's pulling you in
Wrap it up you can't stop
'Cause it feels like an overdose (feels like an overdose)

evacuate the dance floor
(Oh, oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Oh, oh) stop this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. Dj let the music take me underground

evacuate the dance floor
(Oh, oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Oh, oh) stop this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. Dj let the music take me underground

Come on and evacuate, feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate, push it to the top
Come on and evacuate, feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate, you don't have to be afraid

Now guess who's back with a brand new track?
They got everybody in the club going mad
So everybody in the back get your back up
Off the wall and just shake that thang

Go crazy, yo lady, yo baby
Let me see you wreck that thang
Now drop it down low, low
Let me see you take it to the dance floor, yo

Everybody in the club (evacuate the dance floor)
Everybody in the club (I'm infected by the sound)
Everybody in the club (stop this beat is killing me)
Hey Dr. DJ let the music take me underground

(Oh, oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Oh, oh) stop this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ let the music take me underground

evacuate the dance floor
(Oh, oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Oh, oh) stop this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ come burn this place right down to the ground
