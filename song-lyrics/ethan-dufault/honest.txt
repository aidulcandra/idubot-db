We left
It's been a couple years I miss you to death
And I wonder if there's anything left for us
It ended
You said that you meant it
But we changed
I know you're different but I still feel the same
I bet we'd tell each other that it's too late to try and save it
We both learned our lesson

But if we're gonna be honest
I'd tell you that I miss you
That I would do anything to feel you
But I won't
'Cause we both know, oh
That if we're gonna be honest
I'd tell you I forgive you
That I'm so sorry that I hurt you
But I won't
'Cause we both know, oh
That we're not gonna be

It's a mess
I'm tryin' to sleep but we ain't put this to rest
'Cause every time I close my eyes
I see you running circles in my head, woah
I wanna go back to sipping drinks on your porch
So I could take back the little things we ignored
And then you'd know that I never meant to hurt you, baby

But if we're gonna be honest
I'd tell you that I miss you
That I would do anything to feel you
But I won't
'Cause we both know, oh
That if we're gonna be honest
I'd tell you I forgive you
That I'm so sorry that I hurt you
But I won't
'Cause we both know, oh
That we're not gonna be

Honest, honest, honest
That we're not gonna be
Honest
Oh, we both know
Oh, that we're not gonna be
Honest, honest, honest
That we're not gonna be
Honest
Oh, we both know
Oh, we're not gonna be

We're not gonna be
(Honest)
We're not gonna be
(Honest)
Oh, yeah
Yeah, I wanna go back to sipping drinks on your porch
So we could take back the little things we ignored
And then you'd know that I never meant to hurt you, baby

But if we're gonna be honest
I'd tell you that I miss you
That I would do anything to feel you but I won't
'Cause we both know
Oh, that if we're gonna be honest
I'd tell you I forgive you
That I'm so sorry that I hurt you
But I won't
'Cause we both know
Oh, we're not gonna be

Honest, honest, honest
Oh, we'll never be
Honest, honest, honest
