Why, why'd we stop talkin'?
Why, why'd we stop calling?
I miss you, you miss me
Let's make it easy
Tell me the same thing

I'll be the first to say it
'Cause I was always like that
I blame it on a meteor
But I never felt the crash

Now we're two years older
It kinda happened overnight
Remember when the car spun out
I still haven't fixed that light

Maybe I'm sorry
Maybe you're not
It's all the same
It doesn't matter

Why, why'd we stop talkin'?
Why, why'd we stop calling?
I miss you, you miss me
Let's make it easy
Tell me the same thing

Do you still wear the same shoes?
Think about us it's true
I miss you, you miss me
Let's make it easy
Tell me the same thing

Had a dream about you last night
Woke up and my stomach hurt
I miss your voice and Saturdays
That made all the Sundays worse

Maybe I'm sorry
Maybe you're not
It's all the same
It doesn't matter

Why, why'd we stop talkin'?
Why, why'd we stop calling?
I miss you, you miss me
Let's make it easy
Tell me the same thing

Do you still wear the same shoes?
Think about us it's true
I miss you, you miss me
Let's make it easy
Tell me the same thing

Do you miss? Do you miss?
Do you miss me, like I'm missing you?
Do you miss? Do you miss?
Do you miss me, like I'm missing you?
Do you miss? Do you miss?
Do you miss me, like I'm missing you?
Do you miss? Do you miss?
Do you miss me, like I'm missing you?

Why, why'd we stop talkin'?
Why, why'd we stop calling?
I miss you, you miss me
Let's make it easy
Tell me the same thing

Do you still wear the same shoes?
Think about us it's true
I miss you, you miss me
Let's make it easy
Tell me the same thing
