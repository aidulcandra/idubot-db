Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance
Je m'appelle, man's Benz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
(Ayy, Lucid, turn that shit up), ayy

Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance
Je m'appelle, man's Benz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost
Yo, grab the wheel, man's lost

Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance
Je m'appelle, man's Benz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost

Yo, all the beef, can't dead all that
Double it, triple it, bubble it
Ripple it, cuddle it, dribble it, uh, uh
Seen a bad girl jugglin' it, trickle it
'Nuff badman, so I'm comin' in, rippin' it
Listenin', strugglin', killing it, cock it and Smithen' it
Real blue man, man's tickin' it, tickin' it
Verified ting, man's dick in it
Can't compete when a Rapman's sizzlin'

Di-di-dip-dip-dip like Kwengface
Sku-du-du-du on a beat like Senseii
This girl, large back, got a leng face
Moves on pause, got a vid' like Pressplay
Girl's "Tu es beau" like the French say
Jump in a Benz, on the Benz like segway
Can't fit in my screen, got a template
King with my queen on the top, that's checkmate

Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance
Je m'appelle, man's Benz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost
Yo, grab the wheel, man's lost

If I come in a slide, man's tacklin'
East baby from the White, man Chapel it
Yo, the spark on this girl hella cracklin'
Ice on my neck, finna freeze like mannequin
Yo, I'm a real cash man, don't battle it
Scar on my face from the fights man battled in (baow)
Juggle it, saddle it, couple of tracks in it
Bubble the backs in it, uh, uh

Brr, they had me on an astro turf ('urf)
Kickin' the ball to the cats them serve
Man rap, can't cap when a man's been hurt
Now, I jumped on a track when a stacks man learnt
Man's tired of pounds, cash, Green Lantern
Wear Moncs when I'm clear, or Goose with the fur
Trapstar Mikey, can't snooze on a bird
Too rich in the hood, havva call me "The First"

Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance
Je m'a-Je m'appelle, man's Benz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost
Yo, grab the wheel, man's lost

Got the gyal 'dem shake hips in the dance
Je m'a-Je m'appelle, man's Benz (Bow)
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost
Yo, grab the wheel, man's lost
