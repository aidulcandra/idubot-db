Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah oh
Ah ah ah ah

I always knew you were the best
The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest
The star of my show
So many times I wished you'd be the one for me
I never knew it'd get like this, girl, what you do to me
You're who I'm thinking of
Girl, you ain't my runner-up
And no matter what you're always number one

My prized possession
One and only
Adore ya
Girl, I want ya
The one I can't live without, that's you, that's you

You're my special
Little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite, my favorite
My favorite girl, my favorite girl

You're used to going out your way to impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself for me, I'll take you as you are
I know they said, "Believe in love, " is a dream that can't be real
So, girl, let's write a fairy tale
And show 'em how we feel

You're who I'm thinking of
Girl, you ain't my runner-up
And no matter what you're always number one

My prized possession
One and only
Adore ya
Girl, I want ya
The one I can't live without, that's you, that's you

You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite, my favorite
My favorite girl, my favorite girl

My favorite, my favorite, my favorite
My favorite girl, my favorite girl

You take my breath away
With everything you say
I just wanna be with you
My baby, my baby, oh

Promise I'll play no games
Treat you no other way than you deserve
'Cause you're the girl of my dreams

My prized possession
One and only
Adore ya
Girl, I want ya
The one I can't live without that's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you

I want you
(The one I can't live without, that's you), that's you, (that's you), that's you
(You're my special little lady) You're my special little lady
(The one that makes me crazy) The one that makes me crazy
(Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you) You're my favorite girl
(My favorite, my favorite, my favorite) My favorite girl
(My favorite girl, my favorite girl) My favorite girl
(My favorite, my favorite, my favorite) My favorite girl
