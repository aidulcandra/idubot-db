Oh, oh, oh

Lately I've been thinkin'
Thinkin' 'bout what we had
I know it was hard, It was all that we knew, yeah
Have you been drinkin'
To take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve

'Cause nothing can ever
Ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do, yeah
You know there's no one
I can relate to
And know we won't find a love that's so true

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together, oh

I gave you everything, baby
Everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? Yeah
Lost in confusion
Like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day

But that is the past now
We didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be, yeah
Tell me, was it worth it?
We were so perfect
But, baby, I just want you to see

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together, oh

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together, oh
