Do you love the rain, does it make you dance
When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?

When you close your eyes
Tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

I'd spend 10, 000 hours and 10, 000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's 10, 000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
When you think about your forever now
Do you think of me?

When you close your eyes
Tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

I'd spend 10, 000 hours and 10, 000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's 10, 000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh, want the good and the bad, everything in between
Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity
Oh, yeah

I'd spend 10, 000 hours and 10, 000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's 10, 000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

I'm gonna love you, oh yeah(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I, I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I, I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
