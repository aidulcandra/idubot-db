5 a.m. the moon went to sleep
Your friends speaking in tongues in the back seat
Just one little glance, I know what you mean somehow

We're stealing moments, moments away
Why are we just not as good in the day?
Is it too soon to know if it's too soon to say for now?

The bubble we're living in
Setting me free again
I don't know what it is about this

I'm gonna miss it when it's over
Yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October
Yeah, yeah

I felt the weight fall off my shoulders
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's–
I'm gonna miss it when it's done

I can't feel my hands, you laugh like you do
It happened like that according to you
It's only a month, but doesn't feel new somehow
Yeah, yeah
Bubble we're living in
Setting me free again

I don't know what it is about this
I'm gonna miss it when it's over
Yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October
Yeah, yeah
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm gonna miss this when it's–
I'm gonna miss–
I'm gonna miss it when it's over
Yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October

Yeah, yeah
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's–
I'm gonna miss it when it's done

Paint a picture in my brain, encapsulate the fleeting feeling
It ricochets, replays my pain 'til every trace is leaving
The nerve of autumn time days flying by, every sunrise healing me
And we're okay, we'll live this way 'til it's done

I'm gonna miss this when it's over
I hope we never see October
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's–
I'm gonna miss–

I'm gonna miss this when it's over
Yeah, yeah
I hope we never see October
Yeah, yeah
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna miss this when it's–
I'm gonna miss you when it's done

I'm gonna miss you when it's done
