It's 3 in the morning
I can't be dreaming
I' m wide awake
Watching you sleeping
And I realize
There's no place
That I'd rather be

I reach put to touch you
My heart starts to race
At the touch of your skin
There ain't no mistake and I'm lost in your eyes
I see all that I need to see
I'm feeling new things every time that I hold you
I'm telling you things
I would never have told you

I'm feeling my feet coming off
Off the ground
I wasn't looking
But look what I found
I wasn't so sure at the start
Now I wanna be there wherever you are
And I can't deny
How you got me feeling inside

If you think this is
As good as it gets
I swear you haven't seen nothing yet
I promise you I'm
Gonna love you
The rest of my life
My life

You turned a kiss when
No one could find the taste of your lips
I get so excited
I'm losing my mind
The way that
It's supposed to be
Mmm
Everything that we do
Is a thing worth repeating
I only think of you
When my heart is beating

I'm feeling my feet coming off
Off the ground
I wasn't looking
But look what I found
I wasn't so sure at the start
Now I wanna be there wherever you are
And I can't deny
How you got me feeling inside

If you think this is
As good as it gets
I swear you haven't seen nothing yet
I promise you I'm
Gonna love you
The rest of my life
My life

You cannot show
Through the pain
I didn't know what I wanted
Thank you for changing my life

I wasn't so sure at the start
Now I wanna be there wherever you are
And I can't deny
How you got me feeling inside

If you think this is
As good as it gets
I swear you haven't seen nothing yet
I promise you I'm
Gonna love you
The rest of my life
My life

It's 3 in the morning
I can't be dreaming
I' m wide awake
Watching you sleeping
And I realize
There's no place
That I'd rather be
