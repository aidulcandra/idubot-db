It's way too late, but I'm still wide-awake
‘Cause I can't sleep yet, I can't sleep yet
Got a thousand words
That won't stop running circles
Around in my head, around in my head
Sometimes I feel just like these days and nights will never end
But will I ever get this chance again?
So I pray, yes I pray
‘Cause I know the life I want
When it's hard I keep working
I‘ll never give this up
Because I know it's worth it in the end
I know it's worth, worth, worth
Worth it in the end
Because I know it's worth it in the end
I know it's worth, worth, worth
Worth it in the end
Yeah I know sometimes I should relax my mind
And take it easy, take it easy
If I fight my way through every single page
Then I’m a winner, I’m not a quitter, no!
Sometimes I feel just like these days and nights will never end
But will I ever get this chance again?
So I pray, yes I pray
‘Cause I know the life I want
When it's hard I keep working
I'll never give this up
Because I know it's worth it in the end
I know it's worth, worth, worth
Worth it in the end
Because I know it's worth it in the end
I know it's worth, worth, worth
Worth it in the end
It's way too late, but I'm still wide-awake
‘Cause I can't sleep yet, I can't sleep yet
My father said to me
Plant one seed and you can grow a tree
That tree will grow in your field of dreams
If you just believe then one day you’ll see, yeah!
When I'm on the case I know it’s worth it
I’m on the path now I'm running like a circuit
Got my dreams in sight and I'm ready for the fight
Now it’s time to put all of the work in, yeah!
One chance, one shot, no I won't give up
All my faith in God that will keep me strong
As I’m sitting here thinking about this world that we’re living in
Some wasting all their time
When others aim for the sky
I sacrifice some time for my success
I know it’s worth it in the end
Because I know it's worth it in the end
I know it's worth, worth, worth
Worth it in the end
Because I know it's worth it in the end
I know it's worth, worth, worth
I know it’s worth it in the end
