Wrong, but it feels so right
Wrong, but it feels so right
It don't make sense but it feels so nice
Show me, show me, oh
Show me your chest on mine
Show me your legs up high
I don't wanna kiss all night, kiss all night
Ohh

Wrong, but it feels so right
Wrong, but it feels so right
It don't make sense, but it feels so nice
Show me, show me, oh
Show me your chest on mine
Show me your legs up high
I don't wanna kiss all night, kiss all night

If you want me, say you want me
Treading softly, on my body while you tell me
That you're taking it slow, but you're pulling me close
If I bow to the throne, is it better than us?
Give me comfort, give me warm
When I wake, you're always missing in the morning
But you don't need to run if you're looking for love
Said it's only a touch, is it better than us to you?

Wrong, but it feels so right
Wrong, but it feels so right
It don't make sense, but it feels so nice
Show me, show me, oh
Show me your chest on mine
Show me your legs up high
I don't wanna kiss all night, kiss all night

Can't talk with your tongue in my mouth
I was thinkin' 'bout us when you're runnin' about
Saw another one's car at the front of the house
Knew I never meant much, but it's killing me now
Mmm, mmm
Tell me all the things I wanna hear, so come here
Beautiful, anyone will do
But you don't need to run if you're looking for love
If it's only a touch, was it better than us to you?

Wrong, but it feels so right
Wrong, but it feels so right
It don't make sense, but it feels so nice
Show me, show me, oh
Show me your chest on mine
Show me your legs up high
I don't wanna kiss all night, kiss all night

Wrong, but it feels- wrong- wrong- it-
Wrong, but it feels so right- right
It don't make sense, but it feels so nice- nice
Show me, show m-, -ice
