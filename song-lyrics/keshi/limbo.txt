I just been goin' through motions
Back and forth like a ocean
I am a fraud, I am the shit
Hoping that nobody notice

Bang chest in the morning
Head down in the night
Drink less if I wanted
Strike up with the light

And square up, I'm the mightiest, myself in the fight
Hurt twice, but I tried it
No advice for this shit, might die for this shit
Do I feel alive, feel alive, feel alive?

Feel more like limbo, hands out my window
Chasin' that sunset, that's more my tempo
Yeah, that's more my tempo

Ooh, but this is all that I am
I only show you the best of me
The best of me

Looked in my demons and saw myself
Put all my meaning in someone else
Outta sight, outta mind, don't know where to find it
Don't know where to hide, but I still

Eat good, drink good, feel good, it's all good
Can't hear my head when I'm sat beside ya
Fucked lungs and a liver, good looks in the mirror
Do I feel alive, feel alive, feel alive?

Feel more like limbo, hands out my window
Chasin' that sunset, that's more my tempo
That's more my tempo

ooh, but this is all that I am
I only show you the best of me, the best of me
Ooh, tryin', but I'm just a man
Hopin' it won't get the best of me, the best of me
