Hello
Are you awake right now?
God, I just need to hear the sound of you
Please, calm me down
And I know that it's selfish, but
You are the only thing that's
Ever made sense to me, I
I don't wanna do this
I don't know how to do this without you

Cling to your side
Voices at night
Cover my eyes
I'm terrified
No in between
A face on a screen
Ain't an adequate replacement for your being with me
Yeah, yeah

Too much time in the limelight
Gimme your all on the land line
Want it so bad but I won't lie
And it just gets worse in the night time

Never stays for long
And she's gone in the morning

When you come home
I just got over being less of you
When you leave me
I'm in pieces
Maybe it's better if we cut it loose

Tell me how your day was
No, I'm not okay
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Time never moved so slow
Bed time, hit your phone up
Tell me where to go, where to go
Tell me where to go, where to go

Too much time in the limelight
Gimme your all on the land line
Want it so bad but I won't lie
And it just gets worse in the night time

Never stays for long
And she's gone in the morning

When you come home
I just got over being less of you
When you leave me
I'm in pieces
Maybe it's better if we cut it loose

I don't know how to do this without you
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know how to do this without you
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know how to do this without you
