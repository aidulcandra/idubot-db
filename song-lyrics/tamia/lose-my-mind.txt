Is it morning already?
Damn, I was just getting used to you by my side (Don't go)
I'm having trouble getting passed
The part when I had to tell you goodbye
I know you got a job to do and I understand that you gotta go, oh
But I don't ever get no sleep, a moment of peace till I get you home
And it hurts so bad to miss you like that

Everyday my baby's gone away, I just lose my mind, lose my mind
Yes, I lose my mind, lose my mind
Even when I know
That I won't be alone
I just lose my mind, yes I lose my mind, lose my mind

Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side, oh no
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind over my baby, baby
Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind

You just can't imagine, oh, no
The way that you got a hold of my heart, oh oh
And I just can't stand it, no
Everytime I have to watch you apart, oh oh
I know it's kinda selfish but I really just want your love to myself, yeah
Cause every minute I'm alone, it feels like I am going through hell
And it hurts so bad to miss you like that

Everyday my baby's gone away, I just lose my mind
Yes, I lose my mind, lose my mind
Even when I know, I know
That I won't be alone
I just lose my mind, yes I lose my mind, yeah

Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side, oh no
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind over my baby, baby
Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind

What can I do, hey
I'm crazy over you, hey
I hate to see you go, hey
I'm so outta control, hey hey hey
I miss you bad, hey
Soon as you turn your back, hey
It happens everytime, hey
I start to lose my mind, hey, woah

Everyday my baby's gone away, I just lose my mind, lose my mind
Yes, I lose my mind, lose my mind
Even when I know, I know
That I won't be alone
I just lose my mind, yes I lose my mind, oh oh

Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side, oh
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind over my baby, baby
Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind
I start to lose it over my baby, baby
Over my baby, baby
Over my baby, baby
