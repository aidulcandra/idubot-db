Georgia, wrap me up in all your-
I want you in my arms
Oh, let me hold you
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say

"I would never fall in love again until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you

Georgia, pulled me in
I asked to love her once again
You fell, I caught you
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say

"I would never fall in love again until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you

I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
