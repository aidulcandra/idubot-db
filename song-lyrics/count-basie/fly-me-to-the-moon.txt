Hey Frances, I don't know about you but
I kinda need a break
Maybe a trip or something

Fly me to the moon
Let me play up there with those stars
Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars

In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore

In other words (in other words)
Please be true
In other words
I'm in love with you

In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forever more

You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words
Please be true

In other words
In other words
In other words (in other words)
I, I
I love (I love)
I love you
