What will it be like when I get old?

Will I still hop on my bike
And ride around town?
Will I still want to be someone
And not just sit around?

I don't wanna be like the other adults
'Cause they've already died
Cool and condescending
Fossilized

Will I be rich, will I be poor?
Will I still sleep on the floor?

What will it be like when I get
What will I be like when I get
What will it be like when I get old?

Will I still kiss my girlfriend
And try to grab her ass?
Will I still hate the cops
And have no class?

Will all my grown up friends say
They've seen is all before?
They say "Hey act your age"
And I'm immature

Will I do myself proud
Or only what's allowed?

What will it be like when I get
What will I be like when I get
What will it be like when I get old?

Will I sit around and talk about the old days
Sit around and watch TV?
I never want to go that way
Never burn out, not fade away

As I travel through my time
Will I like what I find?

What will it be like when I get
What will I be like when I get
What will it be like when I get old?
