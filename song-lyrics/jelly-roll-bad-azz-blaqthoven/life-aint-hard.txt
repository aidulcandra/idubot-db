[Chorus: Blaqthoven]
Life, Life ain't hard, but it ain't easy, damn sure ain't easy hey
Life, Life ain't hard, but it ain't easy, damn sure ain't easy hey

[Bad Azz]
The world built like a jail, Long Beach ain't nothing but a cell
Today's paper read, Four injured, Two killed that's real
Life ain't getting no longer, Let's get it popping here
Really though, Just like the song is
In life, it ain't nothing I fear
With young rapper got millionaires stealing my lyrics
That's the truth, In all of this essence
And what's a few Gs? Please when you're rich with more blessings
I don't trip, What comes around, goes around again
Like I own the car of the trunk that they found you in
And ain't no telling like Jack told Helen
They'll sell you a key, but not to open the door to heaven
You was talking to the judge, when it could have been the Reverend
Tell him, you should have been free, it could have been me
What would it have tooked for us to see that life ain't easy
Believe me

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz]
Life will throw you a job, know you've been robbed
And purposely leave you, stuck when you're down on your luck
Life will lock you in the cell, praying to heaven just to get out of hell
It seems to be to me it ain't no way out
Life will break a nigga, picking up the pieces, ain't the easiest
I wake up every day just knowing there some Gs to get the gang
Cop a few, watch out for the obstacles
 
Tripping off the politics
Wondering what the cops is doing and they just chilling there and lock me up
My homie was scared, he from them, and they just shot him up
He didn't die, but he cried through the stress
and that's a real hard way to learn a lesson
Yes, indeed it hurts to bleed
You've gotta be as strong as Hercules to deal with this
and don't get killed with this
Cause you know that'll hurt ya mothers heart
and where do we go after we done torn our earth apart singing

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz]
I'm just here, trying to maintain
I let the good times be the medicine for the pain cause life's a headache
I have you bed sick or even dead quick
Cause doctor said to think straight, you need you're head kicked
Left the hospital with stitches, walk and feel like its over like
What could be worse then the police pull us over
Resist the trip and ask the cops
Why you stopping us? Shouldn't you been looking for the trench coat mafia?
He say we look like the type to blast and get popular
Na, we love life more than that, and God's watchin us
It's hard enough for what's up, like for having nigga ? up
Living out his truck
And some times it hurts to live
Doing all this work to live, just to die
I hope my life is justified
I know I'm breathing for a reason, maybe even a purpose
So don't live like you're life is worthless

[Chorus: x2]
