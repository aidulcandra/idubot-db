We the type to pull up to ya party, like, "Wassup wit' y'all?"
E'rybody in this biz know that we don't fuck wit' y'all
Disrespect the fat man, you gon' be the last man
I'ma fuck around and slap one of y'all with a back hand

You a bitch, I won't even hit you with a closed fist
No shit, tell them boys we through with that hoe shit
Try me, you gon' fuck around and meet the Lord quick
Four, Fifth, gotta nose, kinda like a swordfish

No need to back down
The King is back now
The King of White Trash is 'bout to act out
When it's time to smash out
Drink until we pass out
Me and my bitch'll find a bitch and beat the bitch back out

Send me to hell, hey I came back
My arrogant ass is actin' like I ain't fat
I'm on now bitch, and you can't change that
And if you wanna see me, then we can arrange that

It's a lot of jealousy but life goes on
Made it from the bottom, why'd it take so long?
People hatin' on me, it's the same old song
And the hate goes on
And the hate goes on

Gotta lay in the bed if you made yo' own
I'm on fire and I can't go wrong
People hatin' on me, thats the same old song
And the hate goes on
And the hate goes on

Smokin' weed, sippin' syrup
Lately I've been gettin', slurred
Smokin' weed, sippin' syrup
Lately I've been gettin', swerve

I've been drankin', I've been smokin'
Rollin' through the city with my eyes half open
Eyes are rollin', I can't hold it
I'm fucked up and
Everybody knows it

You can keep yo' drama, I don't need that sucker
See I came from the rubber, you can see my hustle
You don't know my pain, you ain't see my struggle
So my middle finger's up like I'm a Diaz brother

Talk shit 'til we pull up
In a full truck
Of fools holdin' tools, all ready to shoot up
Anyone who abused us
Bullied and used us
This is the revenge of the misfits and losers

Hold up, the fat man is on y'all
The Joker's back and Batman is gone, dawg
It's all wrong, so really fuck all y'all
And that's why you on my missed call log

It's a lot of jealousy but life goes on
Made it from the bottom, why'd it take so long?
People hatin' on me, it's the same old song
And the hate goes on
And the hate goes on

Gotta lay in the bed if you made yo' own
I'm on fire and I can't go wrong
People hatin' on me, thats the same old song
And the hate goes on
And the hate goes on

Smokin' weed, sippin' syrup
Lately I've been gettin', slurred
Smokin' weed, sippin' syrup
Lately I've been gettin', swerve

Smokin' weed, sippin' syrup
Lately I've been gettin', slurred
Smokin weed, sippin' syrup
Lately I've been gettin', swerve

I've been gettin' swerve
I've been gettin' swerve
