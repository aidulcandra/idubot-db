His name is Mister Snow
And an upstandin' man is he
He comes home every night in his round-bottomed boat
With a net full of herring from the sea

An almost perfect boy
As refined as a girl could wish
But he spends so much time in his round-bottomed boat
That he can't seem to lose the smell of fish

The first time he kissed me, the whiff of his clothes
Knocked me flat on the floor of the room
But now that I love him, my heart's in my nose
And fish is my fav'rite perfume!

Last night, he spoke quite low
And a fair-spoken man is he
And he said, "Miss Pipperidge, I'd like it fine
If I could be wed with a wife
And indeed, Miss Pipperidge, if you'll be mine
I'll be yours for the rest of my life"

Next moment, we were promised
And now my mind's in a maze
For all it can do is look forward to
That wonderful day of days

When I marry Mister Snow
The flowers'll be buzzin' with the hum of bees
The birds'll make a racket in the churchyard trees
When I marry Mister Snow

Then it's off to home we'll go
And both of us'll look a little dreamy-eyed
A driving to a cottage by the oceanside
Where the salty breezes blow

He'll carry me 'cross the threshold
And I'll be as meek as a lamb
Then he'll set me on my feet
And I'll say kinda sweet
Well, Mister Snow, here I am

Then I'll kiss him, so he'll know
That everything'll be as right as right can be
A living in a cottage by the sea with me
For I love that Mister Snow

That young sea-faring
Bold and daring
Big bewhiskered, overbearing
Darling Mister Snow
