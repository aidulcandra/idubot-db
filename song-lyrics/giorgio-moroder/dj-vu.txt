Witchcraft, voodoo
Love spells, and paint books
Potions, lotion
Perfume to find you

Good men come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
Good men come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby

Oh, my heart ache, but I knew fate
Would send you my way
And when you came, my heart was saved
I've known you for lifetime, baby

I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a déjà vu (déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
And I know I've got nothing to lose

Déjà vu, déjà vu
Déjà vu, déjà vu

Moments in time
I'm yours and you're mine
Two souls, one heart
Two souls, one part

Good men come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
Good men come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby

I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a déjà vu (déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
And I know I've got nothing to lose

Déjà vu, déjà vu

And all the love is fine
Two of a kind
Baby, ooh
And in your loving arms
Here we are, living the dream

And all the love is fine
Two of a kind
Baby, ooh
And in your loving arms
Here we are, living the dream

I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a déjà vu (déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
And I know I've got nothing to lose (déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
And now I've got nothing to lose
Déjà vu
