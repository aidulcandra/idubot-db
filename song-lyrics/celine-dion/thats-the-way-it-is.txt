Yeah

I can read your mind, and I know your story
I see what you're going through, yeah
It's an uphill climb, and I'm feeling sorry
But I know it will come to you, yeah
Don't surrender, 'cause you can win
In this thing called "Love"

When you want it the most
There's no easy way out
When you're ready to go
And your heart's left in doubt

Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

When you question me for a simple answer
I don't know what to say, no
But it's plain to see, if you stick together
You're gonna find the way, yeah

So don't surrender, 'cause you can win
In this thing called "Love"

When you want it the most
There's no easy way out
When you're ready to go
And your heart's left in doubt

Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
(That's the way it is)

When life is empty with no tomorrow
And loneliness starts to call (loneliness starts to call)
Baby, don't worry, forget your sorrow
'Cause love's gonna conquer it all, all

When you want it the most
There's no easy way out
When you're ready to go
And your heart's left in doubt

Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
(And that's the way it is)

Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

That's the way it is (that's the way it is)
That's the way it is (that's the way it is)

Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
