She said, "Baby, I'm afraid to fall in love
'Cause what if it's not reciprocated?"
I told her, "Don't rush girl, don't you rush
Guess it's all a game of patience"

She said, "What if I dive deep?
Will you come in after me?
Would you share your flaws with me? Let me know"
I told her, "Thinking is all wrong
Love will happen when it wants
I know it hurts sometimes, but don't let it go"

'Cause I want you
I want you
I want, I want you
'Cause I want you
I want you
I want, I want you

She said, "What if I tell you all the things I've done?
Would you run away from me?"
I told her, "Baby, we all got bags full of shit that we don't want
But I can't unpack it for you, baby"

She said, "What if I dive deep?
Will you come in after me?
Would you share your flaws with me? Let me know"
I told her, "Thinking is all wrong
Love will happen when it wants
I know it hurts sometimes, but don't let it go"

'Cause I want you
I want you
I want, I want you
'Cause I want you
I want you
I want, I want you, yeah

I want you
I want you
I want you, yeah
