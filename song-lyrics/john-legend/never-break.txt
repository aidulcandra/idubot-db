Oh, yeah

We got a good thing, babe
Whenever life is hard
We'll never lose our way
'Cause we both know who we are
Who knows about tomorrow?
We don't know what's in the stars
I just know I'll always follow
The light in your heart

I'm not worried about us
And I've never been
We know how the story ends

We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Strong enough to stay
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain

We will never
No, no, never
We will never
No, no, never

It's more than a good sensation
It's more than a passing fling
You are the explanation
Of what love really means
It's bigger than you and me
It's one plus one equals three
When we talk about forever
Then forever's what we mean

So I'm not worried about us
And I've never been
No matter what may come our way

We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Stronger than the pain
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain

We will never
No, no, never
We will never
No, no, never
We will never
No, never
We will never
No

The world is dangerous
Throw it all at us
There's nothing we cannot take

We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Strong enough to stay
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain

We will never
No, no, never
We will never
No, no, never
We will never
No, never
We will never
No

We will never
No, never
We will
No
