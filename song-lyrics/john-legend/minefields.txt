Now this might be a mistake
That I'm calling you this late
But these dreams I have of you ain't real enough

Started bringing up the past
How the things you love don't last
Even though this isn't fair for both of us

Ooh-ooh, maybe I'm just a fool
I still belong with you
Anywhere you, anywhere you are

Ooh-ooh, these minefields that I walk through
Ooh-ooh, what I risk to be close to you
Ooh-ooh, these minefields keeping me from you
Ooh-ooh, what I risk to be close to you

Close to you-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I didn't notice what I lost
Until all the lights were off
And not knowing what you're up to tortured me

Now this might be a mistake
We're broken in so many ways
But I piece us back together slowly

Ooh-ooh, maybe I'm just a fool
I still belong with you
Anywhere you, anywhere you are

Ooh-ooh, these minefields that I walk through
Ooh-ooh, what I risk to be close to you
Ooh-ooh, these minefields keeping me from you
Whoa, what I risk to be close to you

Close to you-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh (to be close to you)
Close to you-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh (to you, to you)

Now this might be a mistake
That I'm calling you this late
But these dreams I have of you ain't real enough
