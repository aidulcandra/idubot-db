It's the end of the month and the weekend

I'ma tip myself, I'ma spend it on myself
I'ma drop it like it's pouring, I'ma pour it on myself

Check, check, check
Check that money making bank account number (yikes)

Bitch, I do the money dance, I just made a hundred bands
When the store says "Sign for it, " I'ma leave my autograph

Dollar bills, dollar bills
Watch it falling for me, I love the way that feels
Dollar bills, dollar bills
Keep on falling for me, I love the way it feels

I came here to drop some money, dropping all my money
Drop some money, all this bread so yummy, yeah
Twerking, twerking when I buy the things I like
Dollar, dollars dropping on my ass tonight

Everyone silent, listen to my money talk
Spend how I like it

Give me what the hell I want
Give me what the hell I want

Check that money making bank account number (yikes)
