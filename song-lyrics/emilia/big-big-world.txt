[Chorus]
I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
But I do do feel
That I do do will
Miss you much
Miss you much

I can see the first leafs falling
It's all yellow and nice
It's so very cold outside
Like the way I'm feeling inside

[Chorus]

Outside it's no raining
And tears are falling from my eyes
Why did it have to happen
Why did it all have to end

[Chorus]

I have your arms around me
Warm like fire
But when I open my eyes
Your gone

[Chorus: x2]

I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing
If you leave me
But I do
Feel I will
Miss you much
miss you much
