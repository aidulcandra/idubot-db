I knew when I laid my eyes on you
The lights from above seemed to shine on only you
And you made me feel like I was flying
When I made you sparkle in your eyes
We ain't even 20 baby
I ain't learned to love you right, yeah
Umm, good thing I thought I was the shit back then
I sang in your ear 'cause I wanted you to know
That I had soul baby
I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to make you mine
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed your mind

For the rest of my life you know I'm gonna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine

Finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
I say forever my lady
And kissed you for the very first time
After months, holidays, holding hands in the park
Normally I'll just play basketball
With someone in the park
And I messed up like boys tend to do
It'd be a year till I got back with you
Thank God that you called me back baby
'Cause I'd never be the man that I am today

For the rest of my life you know I'm gonna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine

Then one night upon the phone
You said you were at home alone
I wasn't even old enough to drive
I saw my only chance just to keep it alive
Keep love alive
Good thing for you I stole my daddy's car
'Cause no one's ever gonna love you back
Better than I do

For the rest of my life you know I'm gonna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine

I'm gon' love you baby
Gon' love you baby
Gon' love you right, for the rest of my life
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine
