Breathing, like I'm short on air
And every time we reach a new horizon it's like you don't care
That we're leaving something bare
And in the water I see cold reflections of what's really there

I'm not waiting on love, our time has come
We're fighting empires and I want to feel the fire again
It's not easy to love when the world is numb
We're fighting empires and we're gonna feel the fire again

Feeling, like I can't be there
And all the valleys that we're marching on through not even aware
That it's the darkness that's so hard to see and I'm asking you to fight
Despite the difficulty breaking free from what's really there

I'm not waiting on love, our time has come
We're fighting empires and I want to feel the fire again
It's not easy to love when the world is numb
We're fighting empires and we're gonna feel the fire again

I'm not waiting on love, our time has come
We're fighting empires and I want to feel the fire again
It's not easy to love when the world is numb
We're fighting empires and we're gonna feel the fire again

Tell me the truth, tell me what's bothering you
We know we're future proof, we know we're future proof
Tell me the truth, tell me what's bothering you
We know we're future proof, we know we're future proof

Tell me the truth, tell me what's bothering you
We know we're future proof, we know we're future proof
Tell me the truth, tell me what's bothering you
We know we're future proof, we know we're future proof

Tell me the truth, tell me what's bothering you
We know we're future proof, we know we're future proof
