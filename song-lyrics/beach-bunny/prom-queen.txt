Shut up, count your calories
I never looked good in mom jeans
Wish I was like you
Blue-eyed blondie, perfect body

Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your expectations
I'm no quick-curl barbie
I was never cut out for prom queen

If I get more pretty
Do you think he will like me?

Dissect my insecurities
I'm a defect, surgical project
It's getting hard to breathe
There's plastic wrap in my cheeks

Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your beauty standards
I'm no quick-curl barbie
I was never cut out for prom queen

If I'm pretty, will you like me?
They say, "Beauty makes boys happy"
I've been starving myself
Carving skin until my bones are showing

Teach me how to be okay
I don't wanna downplay my emotions

They say, "Beauty is vain
You'll only be happy if you look a certain way"

I wanna be okay

I wanna be okay
