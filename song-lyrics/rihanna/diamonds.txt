Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea, I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I, we're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive, we're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe as we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die, we're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive, we're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shine bright like a diamond, oh-oh, yeah
Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
