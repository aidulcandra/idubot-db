I'm familiar with unrequited
I know you got a heart that's undecided
Just like mine, it takes it's sweet time
I've been tryin to dive into the deep end
'Cause I don't really wanna lose a good friend
But I might find something divine

It's electric every time we touch
I've been livin' for this head rush
But sometimes it's too much

If we never try
How will we know
Baby, how far this thing could go?
Give me a sign
If I'm on your mind
I don't wanna fall in love alone

I wish that I could tell what you were thinkin
I hate that I slip up when I've been drinkin'
But oh well, I can't help myself

I'm gettin' really tired of this back and forth
Why don't we just give in to this driving force?
I mean, there's somethin' between us

It's electric every time we touch
I've been livin' for this head rush
But sometimes it's too much

If we never try
How will we know
Baby how far this thing could go?
Give me a sign
If I'm on your mind (you know that you're on my mind)
I don't want to fall in love alone (I don't wanna fall in love alone)

If we never try (I don't want to fall in love alone)
How will we know (without you)
Baby, how far this thing could go? (Just how far this thing will go)
Give me a sign (give me a sign, give me a sign)
If I'm on your mind
I don't wanna fall in love alone, ooh

Fall, I don't wanna fall
I don't wanna fall in love alone (you just need to be right here, next to me)
Fall, I don't wanna fall (next to me, next to me)
I don't wanna fall in love alone (I don't wanna live without you baby, anymore)

Fall, I don't wanna fall (anymore)
I don't wanna fall in love alone (I, I, I cant be alone)
Fall, I don't wanna fall
I don't wanna fall in love alone
