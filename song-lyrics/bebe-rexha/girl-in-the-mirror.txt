I'm tired of my thoughts
They weigh me down, feels like I'm drowning
I'm tired of my flaws, they fill me with anxiety and I
Honestly, I'm done with hating pictures of myself
And tryna be like everybody else

I wanna be like, look like
The girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like
No one's watching her
I could try to be just like you
But I wanna be like me
The girl in the mirror

The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror

I'm sick of the likes
And followers, everyone's countin'
I'm sick of the lies
Smilin' but I'm crying inside
Honestly, I'm done with hating pictures of myself
And tryna be like everybody else

I wanna be like, look like
The girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like
No one's watching her
I could try to be just like you
But I wanna be like me
The girl in the mirror

The girl in the mirror

Wanna wake up, no make up
And still think I'm beautiful
Wanna smile, I'm eating
And finally be comfortable with me
Finally be comfortable with me, oh

I wanna be like, look like
The girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like
No one's watching her
I could try to be just like you
But I wanna be like me
The girl in the mirror

The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
